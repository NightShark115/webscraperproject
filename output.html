        <p>Cole made the code that sends the text with the new temperature to the user if the temperature has changed. 
        <p><img src="textcode.PNG" alt="Output code"></p>
        <br>We used a file storing techique to store the temperature in a seperate file so the program could open it every time and see the old 
        <br>temperature, and compare the new temperature that it scraped to it to determine if it had changed.
        <br>If statments were utilized throughout the program (obviously) to locate the temperature depending on the length of the string, which would determine
        <br>the characters it needs to extract to get the temperature. 
        <br>Liam used lists in the GUI to get inputs from the user, along with using tkinker to make the acutal GUI.
